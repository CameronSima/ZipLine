1. Out-of-the-box Real-time Capabilities
   WebSocket & Server-Sent Events (SSE) Support: Provide built-in support for WebSocket and SSE endpoints with seamless integration into the frameworkâ€™s routing and middleware systems.
   Event Broadcasting and Pub/Sub: Integrate a simple pub/sub or event broadcasting system (using Redis or another broker) for real-time features like chat applications, live updates, or collaborative tools.

2. First-class Support for Background Tasks and Workers
   Integrated Worker Queue: Include a built-in task queue system (similar to Celery) for background processing with async task support. Tasks could be defined in the same codebase with decorators and could run in separate worker processes.
   Job Scheduling: Native support for scheduling tasks with a cron-like syntax.

3. Intuitive Error Handling and Debugging
   Error Tracing and Categorization: Introduce a built-in error-handling mechanism that categorizes errors, traces them to their origin, and provides detailed context in logs or error responses.
   Middleware for Debugging: Provide middleware that allows inspecting the internal state, dependencies, and the request lifecycle in real-time.

4. Security Enhancements
   Built-in Security Middleware: Include robust security middleware by default for features like CSRF protection, CORS handling, rate limiting, and DDoS protection.
   Advanced Auth Integration: Built-in support for advanced authentication methods, including OAuth2, SAML, JWT, and OpenID Connect, with easy configuration.

5. Optimized for Serverless and Edge Deployments
   Edge-optimized and Serverless-first: Design the framework to be easily deployable on serverless platforms (like AWS Lambda or Vercel) or edge networks, with minimal configuration and optimized cold-start times.
   Pre-rendering and Edge Caching: Integrate strategies for pre-rendering content and edge caching, making it more performant for static content delivery.

6. Automatic API Documentation with Extensions
   Customizable and Dynamic Documentation: Provide a dynamic documentation system like Swagger or Redoc but with more customization options (themes, plugins) and interactive features, such as example requests/responses based on schema.
   API Versioning and Deprecation Notices: Automatically handle API versioning and provide built-in tools for deprecating old versions gracefully.

7. Declarative Data Validation and Transformation
   Advanced Validation Framework: Go beyond Pydantic models by offering a more declarative approach for complex data validation, transformation, and coercion, including custom validation rules and error messages.

8. GraphQL and gRPC Integration
   GraphQL Server with Subscriptions: Provide first-class support for building GraphQL servers with built-in support for subscriptions.
   gRPC Support: Offer built-in support for gRPC endpoints to enable high-performance RPCs for microservices.

   Schema-first Approach: Focus on a design-first approach where API definitions (using OpenAPI or GraphQL schema) drive the development process.
   Automatic Code Generation: Enable automatic code generation for client SDKs, server stubs, and documentation based on the schema.

9. Data Streaming and Real-time Data Sync
   Built-in Data Streaming: Provide support for data streaming (using WebSockets or HTTP/2) and real-time data synchronization, which is particularly useful for collaborative applications.
